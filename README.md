# AoT-JSON
This repository contains a single file, 4028.json (compressed as 4028.zip), reflecting metadata from the UK Web Archive's "Talking about Health" collection as accessed on 30 April 2023. This JSON file contains both collection- and target-level information on the Talking about Health collection and its subcollections; this collection can be explored on the UKWA site at https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/collection/4028 and is fully accessible at the six Legal Deposit Libraries across the UK and Ireland: https://www.nls.uk/guides/publishers/legal-deposit-libraries/. 
Individual target information is duplicated where websites exist in multiple collections. Additional information on the provenance and intended uses of this dataset can be found in the Archive of Tomorrow project's Datasheet for Datasets.

This dataset is an output of the Archive of Tomorrow project, generously funded by a Wellcome Research Resources Award in Humanities and Social Science, a partnership between the National Library of Scotland, Cambridge University Library, The Bodleian Libraries Oxford, and the University of Edinburgh. The project was supported by colleagues at the British Library, with this dataset in particular reliant on their work developing a standardised output for UKWA/ACT metadata.
